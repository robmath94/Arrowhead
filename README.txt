Arrowhead Software Engineering Candidate Project: College Applicant Classifier.

This project was completed by Robert Mathews and was done in using the Intelij IDE.
I added several tests to check for correctness and edge cases or flaws in my logic as quality is something that I care about deeply.
This project also takes into account scalability and maintainability and uses consistant syntax, easy to understand variable/function naming, and comments throughout the code.
The tests were run using junit 4.

I will be happy to address any questions or concerns you may have regarding my code.
